Detailed workflow

- User imports ScrapeSquirrel
- User has a dataframe
- User invokes Squirrel(df, db_name):
- User invokes Squirrel.store()

--> If there is no SQL database:
    --> Create SQL database db_name.db with columns mapped to df columns
    --> Create the pickle file - df.pkl

--> If there is already a database
    --> Read in df.pkl as df_tmp
    --> Attempt to append the data
        --> If error, such as different columns, explicitly throw the error
        --> Maybe the user had the wrong db_name? Check if there is a DB with matching columns (??)
    --> If successful, delete duplicates
    --> Overwrite the pickle file - df.pkl
    --> Overwrite SQL database with the latest data

--> Print a sweet, sweet message!

- Done. Word up!
