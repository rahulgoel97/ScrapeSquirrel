Squirrels store their nuts, like we store our scraped data...

The objective of this project is to simplify the scraping and storing of data in an SQL database - through which one may build an API for a webapp, or use in a myriad of different ways.

On a high level, the method works as follows:

1. Create an SQL database - init database
2. Scrape some data and store as a pandas df
3. Remove duplicates
4. Store as a pickle
5. Insert into SQL for the first time
6. When new data is pulled in, store into pandas df
7. Append to prior df, retrieved from the pickle
8. Remove duplicates
9. Overwrite pickle
10. Add to SQL
11. Repeat

This can make it simple to store data without worrying too much about SQL and duplicates.

Flow:
Data -> SquirrelScrape -> Unique values stored in SQL.
